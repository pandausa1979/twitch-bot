# Project Improvements TODO

## Project Structure
- [ ] Add `tests` directory for unit tests
- [ ] Add `docs` directory for documentation
- [ ] Reorganize project using src-layout pattern

## Dependencies Management
- [ ] Migrate to Poetry or Rye for dependency management
- [ ] Separate development dependencies from production dependencies
- [ ] Add dependency version constraints
- [ ] Regular dependency updates and security scanning

## Code Quality
- [x] Add type hints to Python files
- [x] Add proper docstrings
- [x] Implement proper error handling
- [x] Add structured logging
- [x] Convert to class-based structure
- [ ] Apply these improvements to all Python files in the project

## Security
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for security-related issues
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Add request validation

## Documentation

- [ ] Add test automation
- [ ] Add performance tests

## CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for:
  - [ ] Automated testing
  - [ ] Code linting
  - [ ] Type checking
  - [ ] Security scanning
  - [ ] Automated deployments
  - [ ] Docker image builds

## Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Implement structured logging across all services
- [ ] Add monitoring for:
  - [ ] API health checks
  - [ ] Performance metrics
  - [ ] Error rates
  - [ ] Resource usage
- [ ] Set up alerting system
- [ ] Add logging aggregation

## Performance
- [ ] Add caching where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add request timeout handling
- [ ] Implement proper error recovery

## Development Environment
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Set up linting (Ruff)
- [ ] Configure type checking
- [ ] Add development environment setup scripts
- [ ] Add Docker development environment

## Next Steps
1. Set up testing framework
2. Add comprehensive documentation
3. Implement monitoring and logging
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Notes
- Code improvements have been started with `get_top_streamers.py` as a template
- Follow similar patterns when improving other files
- Prioritize security and stability improvements
- Consider implementing changes incrementally
